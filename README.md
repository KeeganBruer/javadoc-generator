Javadoc Generator is an extension to VSCode that wraps the commandline javadoc compiler. To use just open
any .java file and run the generator. The generator will then scan the rest of the project and generate a javadoc for the project.

## Disclaimer
This project has not been actively maintained. I plan to rebuild in 2024, so stay tuned if your interested in a complete overhaul to the extension. Get excited for Version 3!
I've graduated university so this rebuild should improve many of the issues that have been reported.

## Usage
The simplest way to generate a Javadoc for your project is to JDK that comes with Javadoc-Generator. You can preform this command
by <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and then selecting "Javadoc Generator: Generate Javadoc".

This generator will first attempt to use the Javadoc located in the JDK referenced in your JAVA_HOME.
If it doesn't find a valid JAVA_HOME it will promt the user for a JDK install directory. If the user doesn't have a JDK installed they can use the JDK that comes packages with this extension by entering "Built In".

The user will then be prompted for the source directory in which your java packages are located. If you have the java project open as the root directory of your workspace, you can leave the field blank and use the default java directory of ./src. 

## Issues
If you find issues, and you probably will, you can report them [here](https://github.com/KeeganBruer/javadoc-generator/issues).
Please include the config.jdgenerator file with your issue report.
